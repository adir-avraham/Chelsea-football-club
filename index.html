        in
        1970 and their first European honour, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of decline in the late
        1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two
        decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history, winning five of their six league titles and the UEFA
        Champions League.[5] Chelsea are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, and
        the
        only London club to have won the Champions League.
