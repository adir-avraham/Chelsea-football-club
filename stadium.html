            Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation.
            It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost
            exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In
            1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby
            land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000
            mÂ²) site.[45] Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald
            Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park.[46] Most football clubs were founded
            first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.

                Starting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original
                capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after Crystal Palace.[45]
                The
                early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that
                covered
                around one fifth of the stand. As the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed, the stand
                eventually
                became known as the "Shed End", although it is unknown who first coined this name. Starting in the
                1960s, it
                became known as the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters.[45] In 1939, another small seated
                stand was added, the North Stand, which remained until its demolition in 1975.[45]
                In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a
                state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.[45] Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was
                beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating
                in
                the freehold being sold to property developers.

                in
                the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the
                mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.[45] The north,
                west
                and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a
                process completed by 2001. In 1996, the north stand was renamed the Matthew Harding stand, after the
                club
                director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year.[47]

                When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the Bates era many additional features were added to the complex
                including two Millennium & Copthorne hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and
                an
                interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities
                would
                provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than
                hoped
                and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the
                club.
                Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea
                as a
                football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of "Chelsea Village" or "The
                Village".
